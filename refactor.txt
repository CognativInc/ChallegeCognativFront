My first has been to modularise Home page and extract from it two components and two arrays.

  -Utils:
    I decided to create a new folder named "utils" with a corresponding file for each variable: fakeRecipies and fakeRecommendations. 
    After creating each file, each variable has been exported to its corresponding component.

  -Components:
    Home.jsx was overloaded with a lot of responsibilities that could be extracted into new components. Thus, I created "components" folder where the components will have each own folder.
    Separating functions from Home.jsx into smaller components, everything is easier to read and, easier to correct (in case of bugs) and it's more scalable.
    In each folder there will be an extra file which will be its corresponding styled-components file.
