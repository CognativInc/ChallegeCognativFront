# Challege Cognativ Front

React challenge for Cognativ.

## About

This project will be used to evaluate your approach on re-order/refactor of javascript, html and css code and react knowledge. Take it easy and keep it simple.

## Required tasks

- Reorganize/refactor the code in a more appropriate and readable way (use your own criteria).
- Transform the style to use styled-components.
- Add responsive design. (Design in the bottom of this file)

## Nice to have

- Convert the project to Typescript creating the correct interfaces.
- Write down some unit tests.

## Design

Use only 1 breakpoint (600px). You can refactor the current style code, but without changing the UI.

<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0" markdown="1">
